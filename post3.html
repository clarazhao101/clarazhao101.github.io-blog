       <h2>Research a Typeface</h2>

       <p>One popular font used on the web is Veranda.</p>
       <br>

       <p>The font was created by Matthew Carter and commissioned by Microsoft. It was made available in 1996.</p>
       <br>

       <p>Designed for use on-screen, the purpose of Verdana is legibility even at smaller sizes on low-resolution computer screens. This was to ensure readers distinguish between letters that are often confused at smaller sizes, such as i, j, l and the number 1.</p>
       <br>

       <p>The font resembles humanist san serifs such as Frutiger. It fairly large and wide with large x-heights, wide typeface, wide spacing and big counters. Because the letters are similar to the style students learn to print in primary grades, the font also has a simplistic feeling.</p>
       <br>

       <p>The font does not have a lot of personality but is functional and highly legible. The font’s clarity and readability are what I like most about it. On the flipside, it can be a little bit dull.</p>
       <br>

       <p><img src="images/veranda.png" alt="image of gmail"></p>

       <p>The font is commonly used in emails such as Gmail. I think this is a proper and effective use of the font because emails are primarily used to communicate information, so clarity and legibility is most important. In addition, a font with too strong of a personality may emotionally charge email messages beyond the writer’s intention.</p>
