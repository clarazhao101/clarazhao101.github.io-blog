       <p>One of my favorite design portfolios is from infographic designer, Nicholas Felton.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Founder of Daytum.com and a member of Facebook’s product design team, Felton’s portfolio is laid out in an unconventional way that immediately makes it stand out.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Instead of going for a traditional block layout, Felton’s homepage is just the name of his projects in vibrant colors that match the theme of the project being described.</p>
       <br>
       <p>This simple layout gives his page a clean and minimal feel, and makes it extremely easy to navigate.</p>
       <br>
       <p>For each project page, fletton uses images that capture the highlight’s for each project and he keeps his descriptions concise and to the point.</p>
