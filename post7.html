       <p>One article on sidebar.io talks about how every product of design is one of opinion, and how if you want to produce high quality design you need develop a strong opinion, but one shaped by that of many others.</p>

       <br>

       <p>I personally partially agree and partially disagree with this thought. On one hand, I think it’s important design with purpose and that each page should have a sort of theme to it that correlates to the content. However, I think opinion is not quite the right word to use.</p>

       <br>

       <p>When I think of opinion, I think of something argumentative. I feel that it is trying to convince me to think a certain way. Even if many others think this way, I still may not feel comfortable with that.</p>

       <br>

       <p>I also think that asserting design needs an opinion, and a STRONG opinion at that, has the potential of making designers resistant to change or unopen to certain styles if said changes/styles do not fit with the “opinion” that the designer strongly holds. These changes might be the key to the business’s success.</p>

       <br>

       <p>I think effective designers should be able to adapt to ach project they are working on and not be holding on to a strong “opinion”. I don’t think we should design to try to convince others of a strongly held opinion. We can convey feelings and messages through design, but opinion just does not seem like the right word.</p>
