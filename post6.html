       <p>The core model is about finding the intersection between business goals and what the user wants to accomplish in order to identify which sections to emphasize and create pathways that lead where you want users to go.</p>
       <br>

       <p>I think this is a very smart strategy for designing websites. I think oftentimes designers become very focused on what the homepage looks like and put all their effort into designing the most beautiful and intuitive homepage, but this article made me realize that the homepage is often not what the user searches for.</p>
       <br>

       <p>This article also helped me think about how the pages on my website should be connected. Up to this point, I think I just decided how my pages are connected based on what looks good on the page or logic such as Blog 1 and Blog 2 should be connected since they come one after the other. However, this article showed me that sometimes the connections are a lot more complex than that and use psychology and mental connections users make to connect pages they seek with pages the business owners wants the user to go to.</p>

       <br>

       <p>However, I think actually employing the core model might be more difficult than it seems. I think it will take significant research with a large sample size to accurately determine what users are looking to accomplish on the website, especially with websites that have many functions such as Facebook, and how all these connections might relate to each other.</p>
