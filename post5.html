       <h2>Mobile First Blogpost</h2>

       <p>In this post, I will talk about the differences in the desktop and mobile version design of Facebook. Just at first glance, the desktop version has three columns plus horizontal menu at the top.</p>

       <p><img src="images/facebook.jpg" alt="image of Facebook desktop"></p>
       <br>
       <p>On the other hand, the mobile version only has one column of content (the main feed) that occupies the entire width of the phone screen. This makes sense as the phone has a much narrower screen so having three columns would mean the user has top scroll left and right off the screen to see the complete content.</p>
       <br>
       <p>As with many mobile versions of sites, the top menu became a footer menu, and the information in the aside section became compressed into a hamburger menu in the corner.</p>
       <br>

       <br>
       <p>Both versions provide all the necessary content, but with different navigation.</p>
       <br>

       <p>The mobile version may be easier or harder to use depending on the person. On one hand, having one column of news feed helps one focus without feeling like thereâ€™s so much going on. On the other hand, someone who wants to navigate to one of the aside sections may find annoyance in the extra step of having to click the hamburger menu.</p>
