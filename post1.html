       <p>One followup question that caught my eye was: in 1989 World Wide Web was established as the standard protocol of the internet--what other options were available for this purpose and why in particular was WWW chosen?</p>
       <br>
       <p>I looked into this and it seems that the world wide web's predecessor, called ARPANET, was made under the context of the Cold War. Originally funded by the US Department of Defense, the ARPANET used packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network. It was made because the US military feared the Soviet Union attacking from space and destroying the US long-distance communications network, which at the time relied on telephone lines and wires. The ARPANET, which connected multiple computers, would keep a communications network active in the US even in the event of a nuclear attack.</p>
       <br>
       <p>I think it's interesting because it shows how the purpose of the internet has changed overtime. It also made me think about whether or not the internet may still be serving more militaristic purposes, especially with stories about the government spying and monitoring people's behavior online. </p>
